# FEATURES ADDED

  - Wind speed, sunset, and sunrise times are shown as well
    - Sunset and sunrise times were converted from UTC (seconds) to the local standard time of the location using the timezone information present in the json file
  - Error detection improved, if no data exists for the API call, it tells the user that no data exists instead of crashing the site
